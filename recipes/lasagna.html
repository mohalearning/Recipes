            lasagne, Italian: is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types, made of very wide, flat sheets.
            Either term can also refer to an Italian dish made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such
            as ragù
            (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and
            Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.
