    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Couscous is originally an Amazigh (aka Berber) dish and for this reason couscous is a staple dish in many North
        African
        countries. In Morocco, we have different types and versions of couscous but if you mention “couscous” in
        Morocco, people
        will usually assume that you are referring to the most basic version of the famous dish: the 7 vegetables
        couscous.

        The 7 vegetables couscous is composed of semolina grains (granules of durum wheat), topped with vegetables and
        meat
        cooked in a super tasty and comforting broth.

        For a long time, I used to think that couscous was one of these difficult recipes designed only for experienced
        cooks,
        and for a long time I didn’t try to make it although I was missing it very much.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600g braising beef or lamb (off the bone), trimmed of excess fat. (i.e. lamb shoulder, cracked lamb shank,
            lamb or beef
            neck, beef shin). If your meat is on the bone, take into account the weight of the bone and make sure you
            get about 125g
            of meat per person</li>
        <li>125g dried chickpeas soaked in cold water overnight and drained (or 250g canned chickpeas, drained)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Generous pinch of saffron</li>
        <li>1 coriander bouquet, tied</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped in 2 cm large pieces</li>
        <li>1 small cabbage (600g), quartered through the base</li>
        <li>1 large sweet potato (250g), peeled and cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>300g turnip, peeled and cut into 3 cm lengths</li>
        <li>3 carrots (300g), scraped and cut into 4 cm lengths</li>
        <li>200g courgettes cut into 5 cm lengths (not necessary for baby courgettes)</li>
        <li>300g butternut squash or pumpkin, seeded if necessary and cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>4 cups dried couscous (650g)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large casserole (minimum 5 litres capacity), heat the olive oil over medium heat and add in the onions,
            meat,
            spices, salt, pepper and tomato pieces. Turn the meat occasionally until lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add 1.5 litres of water and the chickpeas. Bring to the boil, reduce to medium low heat and place the
            coriander bouquet
            in the casserole. Cover with a lid and let gently simmer for 50 minutes. Meanwhile,prepare the vegetables
            and set them
            aside until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Now would a good time to start preparing the raisins and the couscous. The raisin recipe is below and the
            plain couscous
            recipe is here. The raisins are optional but if you like sweet and savoury dishes, you will love this
            addition.</li>
        <li>Carefully discard the coriander bouquet and place the cabbage, turnip and carrots in the broth, cover the
            casserole with
            a lid and leave to simmer for 35 minutes. Make sure the vegetables don't stay at the surface and are
            inserted in the
            broth, otherwise they might not cook evenly</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes to the broth and cover the casserole with a lid for another 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, place some of the broth (about 6 tablespoons) in a separate casserole or large deep skillet over
            medium heat
            and add in the courgettes and butternut pieces. Cover with a lid and cook for 20 minutes until fully cooked.
            Flip the
            courgettes and butternut halfway through cooking. The reason why we cook the courgettes and the butternut
            separately is
            because once cooked, they become very fragile and they might break if you cook them in the broth with the
            rest of the
            vegetables.</li>
        <li>
            At this stage, your broth and vegetables are ready to be served. Adjust the seasoning by adding salt if
            necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using tongs, carefully remove the meat from the casserole and cut the meat into smaller individual pieces.
            To serve,
            place warm couscous grains in a large plate and top with meat, vegetables and some tablespoons of the broth
            to make it
            moist. Add raisins (optional).
        </li>
    </ol>
